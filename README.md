# Murphy_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Summary:

For my project I decided to make a simple relational database using a graph. I implemented the graph with nodes that represent either a person or a grouping(such as a project group or office location) additionally each node can store other individual or project specific information of the users choosing. I have populated my test data with phone numbers and email addresses. My database allows for multi parameter searches to discover the intersection of an arbitrary number of groups. Additionally i have implemented file read and write to output and input the graph nodes and their edges.
